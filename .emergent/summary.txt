<analysis>
The trajectory documents the iterative development and bug-fixing process of a full-stack consortium simulation application. The work began by addressing foundational issues, such as synchronizing an  between the React frontend and FastAPI backend to link user simulations correctly, fixing PDF download failures, and securing an admin panel.

A significant pivot occurred from using Typeform for lead capture to building an internal form, which required new backend endpoints () and integration with MongoDB and Notion. This transition introduced bugs, including incorrect field mapping with the Notion API, which were diagnosed by creating and running a debug script.

A major feature, Análise de Contrato, was added, leveraging the Claude AI API. This feature underwent multiple refinements based on user feedback, evolving from a generic prompt to a highly specialized, multi-page prompt provided by the user to ensure a detailed, legally-grounded analysis of consortium contracts. Debugging this feature involved fixing a 401 API key error and resolving frontend parsing issues to correctly display the structured results.

Further user feedback led to fixing broken financial calculations on the dashboard, converting data visualizations from graphs to tables (Fluxo de Caixa), extending graph data ranges, and correcting logic bugs in probability calculations.

Most recently, a user authentication system with passwords was implemented, upgrading security from simple SHA256 to . The current, unresolved issue is a persistent Erro ao processar solicitação during new user registration, which needs to be debugged. The user has strictly mandated that all future work be confined to the registration/login system, without altering any of the core calculation or analysis logic.

<product_requirements>
The application is a comprehensive consortium analysis tool designed to help users simulate consortium plans and analyze contracts for abusive clauses.

**Core Functionality:**
1.  **Consortium Simulator:** A web interface for users to input parameters (e.g., credit value, term, admin fee) and receive a detailed financial simulation. The output includes CET (Custo Efetivo Total), total amount paid, interactive probability graphs for contemplation (with and without a bid), a detailed cash flow table, and an outstanding balance table. Users can download a PDF report of the simulation.
2.  **Lead Capture & Management:** The system must capture user leads (Name, Email, Phone, Profession). Initially done via Typeform, this was replaced by an internal registration form. All captured leads are stored in a MongoDB database and synchronized with a Notion database for CRM purposes.
3.  **User Authentication:** To ensure persistent access across devices, the application requires a user account system. Users must be able to create an account with an email and a secure password and log in to access their data. A skip registration option for demo access must be maintained.
4.  **AI-Powered Contract Analysis:** A dedicated feature allows users to upload consortium contract PDFs. The system uses the Claude AI API with a highly specialized, user-provided prompt to perform a detailed legal and financial analysis. The analysis identifies potentially abusive clauses, provides recommendations, scores the contract's risk level, and cites relevant Brazilian laws and jurisprudence. The structured results must be displayed clearly in the UI.

<code_architecture>
The application is a monorepo with a React frontend and a FastAPI backend.



-   ****:
    -   **Importance:** This is the monolithic backend file containing all FastAPI application logic. It defines all API endpoints, including simulation calculations (), lead creation (), user login (), and contract analysis (). It also handles database interactions with MongoDB and integrations with Notion and Claude AI.
    -   **Changes Made:** The file was extensively modified to add new endpoints for lead creation and login, integrate  for password hashing, incorporate the detailed Claude AI prompt from , and fix field mapping issues for the Notion API integration.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance:** Contains the large, multi-page prompt provided by the user for the Claude AI contract analysis. Storing it in a separate file keeps the main  cleaner and makes the prompt easier to manage.
    -   **Changes Made:** This file was created to store the user-specified prompt, which was later updated with an even more robust version from a user-uploaded PDF.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance:** The main component of the React application. It manages the global state, including user authentication (, ), simulation results, and conditional rendering of different views (Login/Cadastro, Main Simulator, Admin Panel). It contains the logic for all primary API calls.
    -   **Changes Made:** The rendering logic was refactored to fix a bug where the registration form appeared incorrectly. It was updated to handle the new login/signup flow, fetch data for various graphs asynchronously after a simulation, and correctly map and display new dashboard metrics requested by the user.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance:** This component handles the user interface for both new user registration and existing user login. It includes form fields, input validation, and logic to switch between Cadastro and Login modes.
    -   **Changes Made:** It was created to replace Typeform. Later, it was significantly updated to include a Senha (Password) field and a toggle to switch between login and registration forms. Error messaging was also improved to be more specific (e.g., email already registered).

-   ****:
    -   **Importance:** Manages the UI for the contract analysis feature, including the PDF file upload component and the display of the analysis results returned by the AI.
    -   **Changes Made:** The result parsing logic was updated multiple times to correctly render the structured output from the evolving Claude AI prompts. A fallback was added to display the raw text if parsing failed, ensuring the user always sees the result.

<pending_tasks>
-   Resolve the Erro ao processar solicitação that occurs during new user registration, even when using unique data. This appears to be a communication issue between the frontend and backend.
-   The user has strictly forbidden any changes to the core logic related to financial calculations, statistics, or contract analysis. The focus must remain solely on the registration/login functionality.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently debugging a critical bug in the user registration flow. When a new user submits the registration form from the frontend, they receive a generic Erro ao processar solicitação message. This occurs even with completely new and unique user data (e.g., new email address), ruling out the initial hypothesis of a duplicate email conflict.

The investigation has shown that direct API calls to the  endpoint from the backend testing environment are successful, and the new user is correctly created in the MongoDB database. This indicates the backend logic, including the  password hashing and database insertion, is likely correct.

Therefore, the problem is suspected to lie in the communication layer between the React frontend and the FastAPI backend. The immediate task is to diagnose why the  call from  is failing when it reaches the server, despite the endpoint itself being functional. The focus is exclusively on this registration issue, with a strict directive from the user not to modify any other part of the application, especially the financial calculation and contract analysis modules.

<optional_next_step>
Investigate the discrepancy between the frontend request and the backend expectation by adding detailed logging to both the frontend's  function in  to log the exact data payload being sent, and to the  endpoint in  to log the exact request body it receives.
