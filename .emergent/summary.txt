<analysis>
The AI engineer successfully implemented several features and bug fixes across the application. The initial focus was on refining the probability of contemplation calculations, incorporating conditional logic based on  (1/N vs. 2/N contemplations), and integrating these into the frontend and PDF reports. During this, the cash flow graph was removed as requested. Two critical bugs were fixed: incorrect  calculation post-contemplation and hardcoded  in tables/PDF, now dynamically updated with monetary correction. A significant feature, VPL (Valor Presente Líquido), was introduced as an alternative cost metric when CET calculation fails to converge or is negative. Finally, the probability calculation was refined again, standardizing  to  and , with an optional frontend input for manual participant numbers. All changes were tested and confirmed.

<product_requirements>
The user initially requested a full-stack consórcio simulation application with lance livre methodology, including: a web interface for parameters, CET calculation, cash flow projections, outstanding balance, PDF report generation, interactive graphs, probability of contemplation, responsive design, no initial database, and adherence to a specific UI/UX design.

Subsequently, the following requirements and bug fixes were addressed:
*   **Probability Calculation Refinement:** Conditional probability logic (1/N vs 2/N contemplations) based on . Later, standardization of  and , with an optional field for manual participant input.
*   **UI/Report Adjustments:** Removal of the cash flow graph from the application and PDF.
*   ** Correction:** Correct calculation of the outstanding balance post-contemplation, ensuring only parcel abatements reduce it and the  goes to zero.
*   **Dynamic :** Display of the annually corrected  in both frontend tables and PDF reports.
*   **VPL Implementation:** Introduction of Valor Presente Líquido (VPL) as an alternative cost calculation (10% discount rate) when CET fails to converge or is negative.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer completed the implementation and testing of the user's latest request regarding probability calculation refinements. This involved standardizing the number of participants for probability calculations in  to  and setting contemplations per month to  (one by draw, one by bid). On the frontend, in , the Probabilidades tab was updated to reflect this new default logic, providing an explanation to the user. An optional Detalhar Probabilidades section was introduced, controlled by a new UI state, allowing users to manually input a custom number of participants if desired. Backend changes were verified through , confirming the accurate calculation of probabilities under the new standardized logic. Frontend UI updates were confirmed via screenshots.
