The trajectory details a complex journey of feature development and bug fixing for a consórcio simulation application. Initially, the AI engineer addressed critical  synchronization issues between the React frontend and FastAPI backend, resolving orphaned simulations by ensuring correct token transmission and persistence. This involved multiple iterations of debugging Typeform webhook configurations, frontend state management, and robust lead fetching. Performance bottlenecks, PDF download failures, and admin panel state persistence were also tackled. A significant security vulnerability regarding admin access without authentication was identified and patched. The work then pivoted from Typeform to an internal lead capture form, integrating with MongoDB and Notion, followed by debugging 404 errors for the new lead creation endpoint. Most recently, a new Análise de Contrato tab with Claude AI integration for PDF contract analysis was added, with current efforts focused on fixing a Claude API authentication error and an improper UI rendering bug for the lead capture form.

<product_requirements>
The application provides a full-stack consórcio simulation with web interface for CET, cash flow, outstanding balance, PDF reports, and contemplation probability graphs. It needs a responsive design.

**Key Requirements & Implementations:**
*   **Simulation & Reporting:** Calculates CET, cash flow, outstanding balance. Generates PDF reports and interactive probability graphs (hazard graphs for with bid and no bid scenarios, scaled Y-axis, reducing participants monthly). Displays financial tables with 24-month detail and annual summaries.
*   **Saldo Devedor:** Corrected calculation starting with , annual 5% correction, monthly abatement, reaching zero at term end.
*   **Lead Capture:** Initially via Typeform (ID ) requiring name, email, phone (mandatory), patrimony, income (optional). Stores data and simulation inputs in MongoDB. Later transitioned to an **internal registration form** mimicking Typeform's questions.
*   **Admin Panel:** Visualizes captured leads and simulation data. Enhanced with Brasília timezone display (UTC-3), correct user name parsing, and password protection ().
*   **Data Integration:**
    *   MongoDB: Stores lead and simulation data.  changed to .
    *   Notion: **New requirement** to integrate captured lead data into a Notion database (ID: ) via API.
*   **Simulation Association:** Crucially, ensure all user simulations are correctly linked to their respective leads using a unique  (UUID).
*   **Performance:** Optimized lead capture flow after form submission to reduce delay.
*   **PDF Download:** Ensured PDF reports are downloadable from the frontend.
*   **Navigation:** Fixed admin navigation issues where expanding screen redirected to admin.
*   **Skip Registration:** Added a button to bypass registration for direct simulator access.
*   **Contract Analysis:** **New requirement** for an Análise de Contrato tab.
    *   Initially a text area for contract input.
    *   **Updated:** To accept PDF upload for contract analysis.
    *   Uses **Claude AI** (Anthropic) for analysis, providing a structured report (Summary, Financial Analysis, Attention Points, Recommendations, Score).

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively addressing two critical bugs reported by the user:
1.  **Claude AI Authentication Error (401):** The user reported that the contract analysis feature was failing to read the consortium contract, indicating an issue with the Claude AI integration. The AI investigated the  in , confirmed its presence, and made an adjustment to potentially resolve loading/initialization issues.
2.  **Incorrect Frontend Rendering:** The user pointed out that the  was appearing incorrectly abaixo da tela principal (below the main screen) even when not intended. The AI diagnosed this as a structural error in the conditional rendering logic within  and was in the process of reorganizing the component hierarchy to ensure the  is only displayed when  and .

The last action taken was a code edit to reorganize the frontend rendering structure in  to correctly display the main application content (including the new tabs for Simulator and Contract Analysis) and conditionally render the . The next step is to test these fixes.
