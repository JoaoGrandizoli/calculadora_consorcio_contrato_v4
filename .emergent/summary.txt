The AI engineer's work primarily focused on enhancing a consórcio simulation application by addressing several user requirements and bug reports. Initially, the engineer refined probability calculations, introducing conditional logic based on  and standardizing participant numbers. Key bug fixes included correcting  post-contemplation and dynamically updating . A significant feature was the implementation of VPL as an alternative cost metric. The trajectory highlights several iterations of graph and table adjustments, particularly for hazard probabilities and detailed financial breakdowns, ensuring alignment with the user's provided Excel spreadsheet. More recently, the engineer integrated a lead capture system, including a simple frontend form, a MongoDB backend for storing leads and simulation inputs, and an administrative panel for data visualization. The last active task involves integrating this lead capture data directly into Notion.

<product_requirements>
The user requested a full-stack consórcio simulation application. Initial requirements included a web interface for parameters, CET calculation, cash flow projections, outstanding balance, PDF report generation, interactive graphs, probability of contemplation, responsive design, and no initial database.

Subsequent refinements and new feature requests were:
*   **Probability Calculation & Graphs**: Adjust hazard graphs to show two distinct curves (with and without bid), following  for no bid and  for with bid scenarios, while reducing participants by 2 each month. Graphs should display all months up to the final term with a Y-axis scaled to 100%.
*   **Financial Table Formatting**: Display first 24 months in detail, then annually (every 12 months) for  and .
*   ** Correction**: Correct the initial  to be , and ensure it's corrected annually (5% a.a.) and reduces with monthly payments, reaching zero precisely at the end of the term.
*   **Lead Capture & Data Storage**: Implement a gate for the simulator requiring basic user data (name, email, phone - mandatory; patrimony, income - optional). Store this data, along with simulation inputs, in a simple database (MongoDB).
*   **Admin Panel**: Provide a way to view captured leads and simulation data.
*   **Typeform Integration**: Embed a Typeform for lead capture, ensuring it's direct and doesn't require Typeform login. If Typeform proves problematic, offer a simple direct form.
*   **Notion Integration**: Connect lead capture to Notion, saving user data directly.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was tasked with integrating the captured lead data directly into Notion. This involves taking the lead information (name, email, phone) and the associated simulation inputs and saving them into a Notion database. The AI engineer has just acknowledged this request, planned to implement a simplified integration, and stated Vou implementar isso agora:, indicating that the implementation phase for Notion integration has just begun. The groundwork with a simple lead capture form and backend storage in MongoDB is already in place.

<optional_next_step>
Implement the Notion integration by creating a backend function to send lead data to the Notion API.
