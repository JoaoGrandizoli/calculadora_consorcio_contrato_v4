<analysis>
The trajectory outlines the transition of work from an AI engineer to me, focusing on a consórcio simulation application. Initially, the previous engineer enhanced probability calculations, fixed financial bugs, implemented VPL, and refined graph/table displays. A significant part was integrating a lead capture system with a React frontend, MongoDB backend, and an admin panel, with Notion integration as the next pending task.

However, the current trajectory (Chat Message 2 onwards) shows an immediate pivot. The user requested re-implementing Typeform for lead capture. The primary efforts shifted to integrating Typeform, debugging its webhook, ensuring data flow to MongoDB and the admin panel, correcting timezone display, and critically, synchronizing  between frontend and backend to correctly associate user simulations with their leads. This involved multiple iterations of code edits, testing, and troubleshooting database configuration and frontend token handling. The Notion integration remains unaddressed.

<product_requirements>
The application is a full-stack consórcio simulation tool with a web interface, capable of calculating CET, cash flow, outstanding balance, and generating PDF reports and interactive graphs for contemplation probabilities. It requires a responsive design and initially no database.

**Subsequent and Current Requirements:**
*   **Probability & Graphs:** Hazard graphs for with bid () and no bid () scenarios, reducing participants by 2 monthly, with a Y-axis scaled to 100% for all months.
*   **Financial Tables:** Detailed display for the first 24 months, then annual summaries for  and .
*   ** Correction:** Initial , annual 5% correction, monthly abatement, reaching zero at term end.
*   **Lead Capture & Storage:** Gate access to simulator requiring user data (name, email, phone - mandatory; patrimony, income - optional). Store this and simulation inputs in MongoDB.
*   **Admin Panel:** Visualize captured leads and simulation data.
*   **Typeform Integration:** Embed a specific Typeform (https://caremfo.typeform.com/to/dN3w60PD) for lead capture. If problematic, use a simple form (already implemented as ).
*   **Notion Integration:** Connect captured lead data to Notion (pending).
*   **Admin Panel Enhancements:** Display dates/times in Brasília timezone (UTC-3). Correctly display user names instead of choice options (e.g., Facebook).
*   **Simulation Association:** Crucially, ensure all user simulations are correctly linked to their respective leads.

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack architecture:



-   **/app/backend/server.py**:
    -   **Importance:** Core backend logic, FastAPI endpoints, financial calculations, probability functions, PDF generation, and data handling.
    -   **Changes Made:**
        -   Added  endpoint.
        -   Modified  to log raw Typeform data, become more flexible in data parsing, then refined to accept specific text fields for name (ignoring choice fields), and later reverted to be less restrictive for debugging missing data.
        -   Added detailed logging for the  header in the  endpoint to debug  issues.
-   **/app/backend/requirements.txt**:
    -   **Importance:** Python dependencies.
    -   **Changes Made:** No new dependencies added in this trajectory,  and  were previously added.
-   **/app/backend/.env**:
    -   **Importance:** Backend environment variables.
    -   **Changes Made:** Changed  from  to  to ensure consistent database usage.
-   **/app/frontend/src/App.js**:
    -   **Importance:** Main React component managing UI state, API calls, and rendering.
    -   **Changes Made:**
        -   Modified  to include token expiration (24 hours) and robust local storage cleanup, forcing re-registration when necessary.
        -   Implemented logic for robust synchronization after Typeform submission, including hiding the Typeform, waiting for webhook processing, fetching the latest lead, saving the correct  to local storage, and then displaying the simulator.
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/LeadCapture.js**:
    -   **Importance:** Component responsible for lead capture.
    -   **Changes Made:** Refactored to embed Typeform using the  library and handle its callback. An initial attempt was made to directly use the webhook's returned token here, which was later shifted to .
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/SimpleForm.js**:
    -   **Importance:** Alternative, direct lead capture form.
    -   **Changes Made:** None in this trajectory, it serves as a fallback.
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/AdminPanel.js**:
    -   **Importance:** UI for visualizing captured lead and simulation data.
    -   **Changes Made:** Modified the  function to display dates and times in the Brasília timezone (UTC-3).
-   **/app/frontend/.env**:
    -   **Importance:** Frontend environment variables.
    -   **Changes Made:** None explicitly recorded in this trajectory.
-   **/app/frontend/package.json**:
    -   **Importance:** Frontend dependencies.
    -   **Changes Made:**  was added.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   Integrate lead data directly into Notion (initial task from previous agent's summary).
-   Resolve the issue where simulations are not being correctly associated with user leads due to the frontend not sending the correct  in simulation requests.
-   Ensure correct display of user names in the admin panel, avoiding capture of choice fields (e.g., Facebook) as names.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively debugging a critical issue: user simulations are not being correctly associated with their respective leads. The backend receives simulation data, but the  and  fields are often , indicating a failure in the frontend to transmit the correct .

Previous attempts to fix this included:
1.  **Frontend  synchronization:** Trying to synchronize the  generated by the Typeform webhook with the frontend's state, initially by having  handle it, then shifting logic to .
2.  **Database Name Correction:** A  identified that the backend was incorrectly searching for leads in  instead of , which was corrected in . However, this did not fully resolve the association issue.
3.  **Robust Frontend Synchronization:** Implemented a robust synchronization mechanism in  to forcefully hide the Typeform, wait for webhook processing, fetch the latest valid lead, and save its  to localStorage before enabling the simulator.
4.  **Admin Panel Fixes:** Addressed minor issues like displaying dates in Brasília timezone and attempted to fix the  to correctly parse user names.

Despite these efforts, the core problem persists. The current step involves adding detailed logging to the backend's  endpoint to capture the  header and the  being sent (or not sent) by the frontend during a simulation request. The user has just been asked to perform a new simulation so these new logs can be analyzed.
